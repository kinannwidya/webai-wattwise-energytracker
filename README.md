## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out
- Futuristic dark-blue + cyan glow interface for a modern electric vibe  
- Real-time usage monitoring with live graph updates  
- 7-day electricity consumption forecast using LSTM, BiLSTM, and CNN  
- Smart billing estimation based on predicted usage  
- Built with React frontend, FastAPI backend, and TensorFlow AI models
